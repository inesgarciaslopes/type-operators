A grammar in \emph{Greibach normal form} \cite{AutebertG84} is a tuple of the form $(\mathcal{T, N}, \ntgamma, \mathcal{R})$, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{T}$ is a finite set of terminal symbols, $\tsymc{a}$, $\tsymc{b}$, $\tsymc{c}$; 
	\item $\mathcal{N}$ is a finite set of non-terminal symbols, $\Xnt, \Ynt, \Znt$;
	\item $\ntgamma\in\mathcal{N}^*$ is the starting word;
	\item $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \N \times \T \times \N^*$ is a finite set of productions.
\end{itemize}
A production rule in $\mathcal{R}$ is written as $\ltsred{\Xnt}{a}{\ntdelta}$: the left side of the arrow must be a non-terminal, $\Xnt\in\mathcal{N}$, while the right side must be a word. Note that $\ntdelta$ can be the empty word. Grammars in GNF are \emph{simple} when for every non-terminal and terminal symbol there is at most one production $\ltsred{\Xnt}{a}{\ntdelta}$ \cite{KorenjakH66}.

Deciding whether two (renamed) types are bisimilar takes two steps: the first phase is based on function $\word({\typec{T}})$, described in Figure \ref{fig:word}, that translates types to words of non-terminal symbols.

Then, we have to check if two grammars are bisimilar, that is if $\word({\typec{T}}) \gequiv \word({\typec{U}})$. The algorithm used to check the bisimilarity of simple grammars is the one introduced by Almeida et al. \cite{AlmeidaMV20}.
