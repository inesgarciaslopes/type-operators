    Context-free session types emerged from the need to expand session type theory to non-regular protocols. Their inclusion in type systems enhances the expressiveness and adaptability of communication protocols in programming languages, yet pose a significant challenge for type equivalence algorithms. In this work, we study System $F^{\mu_*;}_\omega$, the higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus equipped with equirecursive and context-free session types, as well as its seamless integration into FreeST, a functional programming language governed by context-free session types.
    We follow a bisimulation-based approach to type equivalence, translating types into simple grammars and verifying the bisimilarity of these grammars, a problem that is decidable.
