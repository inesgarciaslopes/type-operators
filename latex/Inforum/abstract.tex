    Context-free session types emerged from the need to expand session type theory to non-regular protocols. Their inclusion in type systems enhances the expressiveness and adaptability of communication protocols in programming languages, yet pose a significant challenge for type equivalence algorithms. In this work, we study System $F^{\mu_*;}_\omega$, the higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus equipped with equirecursive and context-free session types, as well as its seamless integration into FreeST, a functional programming language governed by context-free session types.
    We follow Po\c{c}as et al. \cite{PocasCMV23} type equivalence approach, translating types to simple grammars and checking the bisimilarity of simple grammars, a problem which is decidable.
