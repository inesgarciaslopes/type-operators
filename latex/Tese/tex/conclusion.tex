\chapter{Conclusion}

To summarize, we investigated the integration of  $F^{\mu_*;}_\omega$ with context-free session types into the functional programming language FreeST. Context-free session types enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of communication protocols in programming languages, surpassing the limitations of regular session types. 

Our research tackled the significant challenges posed by type equivalence algorithms within this advanced type system. We emphasized the importance of handling recursive types separately to ensure the termination of normalisation. By refining reduction rules and employing a pre-kinding approach, type formation is decidable.

By reducing the problem to the bisimilarity of simple grammars, a robust solution for type equivalence checking is met, facilitating the implementation of advanced type systems in real-world programming languages.
