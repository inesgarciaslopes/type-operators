\section{Adding Type Operators}


\input{./tex/kinds-types.tex}

In programming languages, terms are categorized by types, which in turn may be categorized by kinds. In our system, a \emph{kind} $\kind$ is either a base kind $\kast$---which is either a session or a functional kind, $\skind$ or $\tkind$, respectively---or a higher-order kind  $\karrow \kind \kindp$. A \emph{proper type} refers to a type that has a base kind. In contrast, \emph{type operators} act upon types to create more complex types, and are associated with higher-order kinds. For example, the type operator $\Arrow$ takes two types, $\typec{T}$ and $\typec{U}$, and constructs a new type, a function type $\Arrow \typec{T} \typec{U}$, which we sometimes write in infix notation as $\typec{T}\ \Arrow\ \typec{U}$. This is the core of our work. Our goal is to expand the programming language FreeST, currently limited to types of kind $\kast$, to higher-order kinds.

A type is either a type constructor $\tiota$, a type variable $\talpha$, an abstraction $\tabs{\talpha}{\kind}{\typec{T}}$ or an application $\tapp{\typec{T}}{\typec{T}}$. A detailed list of types and constructors is in. Observe that $\tmuinfix{\alpha}{\kind}{T}$ is syntactic sugar for $\typec{\tmu\kind (\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{T})}$ and similarly for $\tquantinfix\alpha\kind \TT$.


\section{Reduction and Weak Head Normal Form}
\input{./tex/type-reduction.tex}

\todo{paragrafo de ligação.}
Not all types are of interest---for example $\tapp{\Dual}{\forallt{\skind}{\tabs{\alpha}{\skind}{\alpha}}}$ since the dual operator makes no sense being applied to a functional type. Before we can discuss type formation, we must define the weak head normal form of a type; we do so by defining a system of reduction rules in. This system is that of Poças et al. made confluent by adding the proviso that $\typec{T} \neq \typec{\seqcomp{T_1}{T_2}}$ to rules \rseqtwo and \rdctx. \emph{Confluence} states that, if there are two distinct reductions for a given type, $\afunction{T}{U}$ and $\afunction{T}{V}$, then both paths will eventually converge into the same final reduced type $\typec{W}$. Our variant features a single reduction path, thus confluence immediately follows.
%With respect to Po\c{c}as et al. , we promoted polymorphism to kind $\skind$, which entails the introduction of the existential type $\texists \kind$, dual of $\tforall \kind$, and the corresponding reduction rules.



A type is in \emph{normal form}, denoted $\iswhnf{T}$, if it has been completely reduced, \textit{i.e.}, no further reductions are possible. In other words, $\iswhnf{T}$ iff $\typec{T} \nrightarrow$. Then we can say that type $\typec{T}$ \emph{normalises} to type $\typec{U}$, written $\isnorm{T}{U}$, if $\iswhnf{U}$ and $\typec{U}$ is reached from $\typec{T}$ in a finite number of reduction steps. The predicate $\isnormalised{T}$ means that $\isnorm{T}{U}$ for some $\typec{U}$.
Note that not all types normalise, \ie some have an infinite sequence of reductions, such as $\TT = \typec{(\lambda x. xx)(\lambda x. xx)} \longrightarrow \typec{(\lambda x. xx)\subs{(\lambda x. xx)} {x}} = \TT \longrightarrow \typec{\cdots}$---which is stuck in a loop of reductions to itself via the application of rule \rbeta---and $\UT = \typec{\tmu\skind (\tlambda{\alpha}{\skind}{\alpha;\Skip})} \rightarrow (\tlambda{\alpha}{\skind}{\alpha;\Skip})\UT \rightarrow \typec{U;\Skip} \rightarrow_2 \typec{U;\Skip;\Skip} \rightarrow \typec{\cdots}$---which successively applies rules \rmu, \rbeta in combination with \rseqtwo, resulting in the unending addition of a trailing $\Skip$.

\section{Type Formation}

Finally, we introduce \emph{well-formed types}. We use $\judgementrelctx{\Delta}{\typec{T}}{\colon}{\kind}$ to denote that $\typec{T}$ is a \emph{well-formed type} with kind $\kind$ under the kinding context $\Delta$, a map from type variables to kinds. 
The kinds of constants can be found in. A variable $\talpha$ has kind $\kind$ if $\tbind\alpha\kind\in{\Delta}$. An abstraction $\tabs\alpha \kind \TT$ has kind $\karrow \kind {\kind'}$ if $\TT$ is well-formed. Note that $\Delta + \tbind\talpha\kind$ in rule \ktabs represents updating the kind of the type variable $\talpha$ to a new kind $\kind$ in the context $\Delta$ if $\tbind\talpha\kindp\in\Delta$ for some $\kindp$, or storing the kind of $\talpha$ in the context $\Delta$ if otherwise. Finally, rule \ktapp states that an application $\tapp T U$ is well-formed if $\TT$ and $\UT$ are types and $\tapp TU$ normalises, that is, $\isnormalised {\tapp TU}$.

\todo{problem: not all types normalise. paragrafo de ligação}

\subsection{Decidability of type formation}
%We prove decidability of type formation, imposing a restriction to kind * for recursive types, also adopted by Poças et al.

The rules for type formation in \cref{fig:type-formation} involve determining if an application type $\TT\UT$ normalises.
Poças et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/PocasCMV23} propose a two-step solution to this problem.
The first stage is the introduction of the concept of \emph{pre-kinding}. We denote this as $\prekind \Delta T \kind$, that is, $\typec{T}$ is pre-kinded with kind $\kind$ under the kinding context $\Delta$. The rules for pre-kinding are in \cref{fig:pre-kinding}. They differ from the rules for type formation in that, in rule \pktapp, there is no verification of the normalisation of $\TT\UT$. Pre-kinding excludes some (but not all) types that do not normalise, as is the case of $\typec{(\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{\alpha \alpha})(\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{\alpha \alpha})}$ in \cref{fig:ex-pre-kinding}.

\input{./tex/pre-kinding.tex}

		}
	\end{equation*}
	\caption{Example of an unsuccessful derivation for a pre-kind goal.}
    % $\prekind {} {(\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{\alpha \alpha})(\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{\alpha \alpha})} {\kind'}$.}
	\label{fig:ex-pre-kinding}
\end{figure}

For a type which is pre-kinded, termination of $\isnormalised {\TT}$ is guaranteed. Some recursive types are problematic for normalisation, as the application of reduction might not decrease their size. For example, the type $\tmu\skind\ (\tabs\alpha\skind {\alpha;\Skip})$ is pre-kinded but successive reduction steps---via \rmu and \rbeta---keep adding $\typec{;}\Skip$ to the tail of the type so we must conclude that it does not normalise.
When dealing with normalisation, we separate the treatment of recursive types from the remaining types.
In particular, we divide the reduction rules in two groups: $\muarrow$ refers to reductions that use the $\rmu$ rule and $\lseqarrow$ refers to reductions that never invoke the $\rmu$ rule. Thus, $\betaarrow\ =\ \lseqarrow\cup\muarrow$. We may now lift this notion to normalisation, denoted by $\lseqnormalred TU$ and $\munormalred TU$ respectively.

In order to check if a type $\TT$ is well-formed, we first determine if $\prekind{} T \kind$ for some $\kind$. If $\TT$ fails to be pre-kinded, it is not kinded either. Otherwise, we check whether $\istype{} T \kind$, which involves determining if the application types within $\TT$ normalise. 

\subsection{Restrictions to Recursion}
The approach to determine if a type normalises seeks infinite reduction sequences. In the case of recursive types, such sequences would have a finite number of $\beta$-reductions between two $\mu$-reductions.
$\TT = \lseqnormalred{\typec{T_0}}{\typec{T'_0}}\mured{}{\typec{T_1}}\lseqnormalred{}{\typec{T'_1}}\mured{}{\typec{T_2}}\lseqnormalred{}{\typec{T'_2}}\mured{}{\cdots}$.
If $\typec{T'_i}$ does not reduce by any $\mu$-reduction, we can conclude that
$\typec{T}$ normalises. Otherwise, since $\tmu\kast \UT$ is restricted to a base
kind $\kast$, it must reduce by one of following cases.
\begin{align*}
\typec{T'_i} &= \mured{\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT}{\tapp\UT{(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)}} & (\rmu)
\\
\typec{T'_i} &= \mured{\semit{(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)}{V}}{\semit{(\tapp U{(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)})}{V}} & (\rseqtwo)
\\
\typec{T'_i} &= \mured{\tdual{(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)}}{\tdual{(\tapp U {(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)})}} & (\rdctx)
\\
\typec{T'_i} &= \mured{\semit{(\tdual{(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)})}{V}}{\semit{(\tdual{(\tapp U {(\tapp{\tmu\kast}\UT)})})}{V}} & (\rseqtwo + \rdctx)
\end{align*}
We can easily notice that expression $\tmu\kast\UT$ reappears after the $\mu$-reduction, indicating potential infinite sequences. We can detect these by tracking occurrences of $\tmu\kast\UT$ and halting if a repetition is found.
%The following pseudo-code illustrates the process for determining if $\typec{T}$ normalises: 
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    normalises(visited, t) = 
%        if reducesByBSD(t) then

%            Nothing -- found an infinite sequence

\section{Type equivalence + Decidability of type equivalence}

\todo{paragrafo de ligação}

Type equivalence allows us to check whether two types, even if syntactically different, correspond to the same protocol. 
It is expected that two types that are alpha-congruent are equivalent, like for example $\tlambda{\alpha}{\kind}{\alpha}$ and $\tlambda{\beta}{\kind}{\beta}$. However, the task of checking if two types are equivalent may involve substitutions on-the-fly as one crosses along the types. We will avoid this by performing a renaming operation once on both types, right at the beginning of the type equivalence checking process. 

Inspired by the renaming approach of Gauthier and Pottier \cite{GauthierP04}, we introduce \textit{minimal renaming}, which uses the least amount of variable names necessary.
%This notion of minimal renaming enables the translation of types into simple grammars.
This renaming operation, defined in figure \ref{fig:rename} consists on replacing a type \typec{T} by its minimal alpha-conversion. We assume that a countable ordered set of (fresh) type variables, $\{\typec{\upsilon_1},\ldots,\typec{\upsilon_n},\ldots\}$, is available. We rename bound variables in \typec{T} by the smallest possible variable available, \textit{i.e.}, the first which is not free on the type. Note that the $S$ parameter in the definition corresponds to the set of unavailable type variables for renaming.  Also, by $\first(S)$ we mean the smallest variable not in the set $S$. The notion of variable substitution, $\typec{T}\subs{v}{\talpha}$, and free variables of a type, $\fv(\TT)$, are the standard ones from literature \cite{tapl}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \declrel{Type renaming}{$\rename_S(\TT)$}
  \begin{align*}
    \rename_S(\typec\iota)&=\typec\iota
    \\
    \rename_S(\typec\alpha)&=\typec\alpha

    \rename_S(\tabs{\alpha}{\kind}{T}) &=
    \tabs{\upsilon}{\kind}{{\blk{\rename_S(}}T\subs\upsilon\alpha})
    \quad\text{where } \typec{\upsilon} = \first(S\cup\fv(\tabs{\talpha}{\kind}{T}))
    \\
    \rename_S(\tapp{T}{U}) &= \rename_{S\cup\fv(\UT)}(\TT)\rename_S(\UT)
  \end{align*}
  \caption{Type renaming.}
  \label{fig:rename}
\end{figure}

%Po\c{c}as et al propose three possible ways to check whether two (renamed) types are equivalent:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item by using a set of coinductive rules;
%    \item by means of a bisimulation on types, built from a labelled transition system;
%    \item by translating types to grammars and checking bisimulation of grammars.
%\end{itemize}
%
%We focus on the third approach, which we detail in.

Following Poças et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/PocasCMV23}, the problem of checking whether two (renamed) types are equivalent is reduced to translating types into grammars and checking bisimilarity. A grammar in \emph{Greibach normal form} \cite{AutebertG84} is a tuple $(\mathcal{T, N}, \ntgamma, \mathcal{R})$, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{T}$ is a finite set of terminal symbols, $\tsymc{a}$, $\tsymc{b}$, $\tsymc{c}$; 
	\item $\mathcal{N}$ is a finite set of non-terminal symbols, $\Xnt, \Ynt, \Znt$;
	\item $\ntgamma\in\mathcal{N}^*$ is the starting word;
	\item $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \N \times \T \times \N^*$ is a finite set of production rules.
\end{itemize}

A production rule in $\mathcal{R}$ is written as $\ltsred{\Xnt}{a}{\ntdelta}$. Grammars in GNF are \emph{simple} when, for every non-terminal symbol $\Xnt$ and every terminal symbol $\tsymc{a}$, there is at most one production rule $\ltsred{\Xnt}{a}{\ntdelta}$ \cite{KorenjakH66}.

\input{./tex/word.tex}

The function $\word({\typec{T}})$, described in \cref{fig:word}, translates types to words of non-terminal symbols. If a type $\TT$ is in weak head normal form, the construction of $\word(\TT)$ updates the set of productions of $\TT$, according to one of the cases found in $\word'$. If $\TT$ is not in weak head normal form and normalises to $\Skip$, $\word(\TT)$ returns the empty word; otherwise, if there exists a type $\UT\neq \Skip$ such that $\TT$ normalises to $\UT$, $\word(\UT) = \Znt \ntdelta$ and $\Ynt$ a fresh new terminal, then for each production of $\Znt$ of the form $\gltsred Z a {\gamma}$, $\Ynt$ has a production of the form $\gltsred Y a {\gamma\delta}$. 
The application of the $\word$ function to a type $\TT$ terminates producing a simple grammar. This is only possible because our well-formed types normalise, and all of its subterms normalise as well. Furthermore, we keep track of already visited types which enable reusing non-terminal symbols, which is crucial for dealing with recursive types.

We check whether two types are equivalent by translating the (renamed) types to a simple grammar, and then checking their bisimilarity, \ie if $\word({\typec{T}}) \gequiv \word({\typec{U}})$. The algorithm used to check bisimilarity of simple grammars is in \cite{AlmeidaMV20}.

Consider the type $
\typec{T_0} = \tabs{\beta}{\tkind}{\tmuinfix{\alpha}{\skind}{\extchoice\rchannel{\leafl}{\Skip}{\nodel}{\alpha\Semi\ \INp\beta\Semi\ \alpha}}\Semi\Wait}$ described in \cref{sec:intro}. We will demonstrate how the construction of $\word(\typec{T_0})$ terminates generating a simple grammar.
Since $\typec{T_0}$ is in weak head normal form, $\word(\typec{T_0})$ returns a fresh symbol, which we call $\nsymc{X_0}$. We also add to the set of productions the production $\gltsred{X_0}{\lambda\beta\colon\tkind}{\wordb{\typec{T_1}}}$, where
$\typec{T_1}$ is the type $\tmuinfix{\alpha}\skind{\extchoice\records{\leafl\colon\Skip,\nodel\colon\semit{{\alpha}}{\semit{\INn{\beta}}{{\alpha}}}}\Semi\Wait}$.

Now $\typec{T_1}$ is not in weak head normal form, so we must normalise it in order to obtain $\typec{T_2}$ such that $\normalred {T_1} {T_2}$. Then, $\word(\typec{T_1})$ returns a fresh non-terminal which we call $\nsymc{X_1}$. To obtain the productions of $\typec{T_1}$, we need to compute $\word(\typec{T_2})$, that returns a fresh symbol $\nsymc{X_2}$. Since $\typec{T_2} = \typec{\extchoice\records{\leafl\colon\Skip,\nodel\colon\semit{T_1}{\semit{\INn {\beta}}{T_1}}}\Semi\Wait}$ we need to compute $\wordb{\typec{T_2}} = \word({\typec{T_3}})\word({\Wait})$. We have that $\wordb{\Wait} = \nsymc{X_4}$ and $\gltsred{X_4}{\tsymc{\waitl}}{\bot}$ but we still need to compute $\wordb{\typec{T_3}}$. This computation results in a fresh non-terminal $\nsymc{X_3}$ with productions $\gltsred{X_3}{\&_1}{\wordb{\Skip}}$ and $\gltsred{X_3}{\&_2}{\wordb{\semit{T_1}{\semit{\INn{\beta}}{T_1}}}}$. Therefore, the transitions for $\nsymc{X_2}$ are $\gltsred{X_2}{\&_1}{\nsymc{X_4}}$ and $\gltsred{X_2}{\&_2}{\nsymc{X_3}\nsymc{X_4}}$.

At last, we must compute $\word(\semit{T_1}{\semit{\INn{\beta}}{T_1}})$, which is a fresh symbol $\nsymc{X_5}$, because this type is not in weak head normal form. This type normalises to $\semit{T_2}{\semit{\INn{\beta}}{T_1}}$, since $\normalred{T_1}{T_2}$, therefore the productions of $\nsymc{X_5}$ are the concatenation of $\word(\typec{T_2})\word(\INn{\beta})\word(\typec{T_1})$. At this point, we know that $\word(\typec{T_2})=\nsymc{X_2}$ and $\word(\typec{T_1})=\nsymc{X_1}$. Thus, we just need to compute $\word(\INn{\beta})$, which is a fresh symbol $\nsymc{X_6}$ with productions $\gltsred{X_6}{?_1}{\wordb{\typec{\beta}}\bot}$ and $\gltsred{X_6}{?_2}{\emptyword}$. Finally, $\word(\typec{\beta})$ is a fresh symbol $\nsymc{X_7}$ with a production $\gltsred{X_7}{{\beta}}{\emptyword}$. This means that $\word(\semit{T_2}{\semit{\INn{\beta}}{T_1}}) = \nsymc{X_2X_6X_1}$, which we write as $\gltsred{X_5}{\&_1}{X_4X_6X_1}$ and $\gltsred{X_5}{\&_2}{X_3X_4X_6X_1}$.

Putting everything together, we obtain the following simple grammar:
%
\begin{align*}
\gltsred{X_0}{\lambda{\beta}\colon\tkind}{X_1}
&&
\gltsred{X_1}{\&_1}{X_4}
&&
\gltsred{X_1}{\&_2}{X_3X_4}
&&
\gltsred{X_2}{\&_1}{X_4}
\\
\gltsred{X_2}{\&_2}{X_3X_4}
&&
\gltsred{X_3}{\&_1}{\emptyword}
&&
\gltsred{X_3}{\&_2}{X_5}
&&
\gltsred{X_4}{\tsymc{\waitl}}{\bot}
\\
\gltsred{X_5}{\&_1}{X_4X_6X_1}
&&
\gltsred{X_5}{\&_2}{X_3X_4X_6X_1}
&&
\gltsred{X_6}{?_1}{X_7\bot}
&&
\gltsred{X_6}{?_2}{\emptyword}
&& 
\gltsred{X_7}{\beta}{\emptyword}
\end{align*}
